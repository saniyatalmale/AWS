## ✅ 1. **Basic AWS Questions**

### Q1. What is AWS?

**Ans:**
AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a cloud platform provided by Amazon that offers services like computing power, storage, networking, databases, machine learning, and more on a pay-as-you-go basis.

---

### Q2. What are the benefits of using AWS?

**Ans:**

* Scalability
* Cost-effective (pay-as-you-go)
* High availability
* Security
* Flexibility
* Global infrastructure

---

### Q3. What is the difference between Region and Availability Zone?

**Ans:**

* **Region**: A geographical location (e.g., Mumbai, US-East)
* **Availability Zone (AZ)**: A data center (or group of them) inside a region
* Each Region has multiple AZs for high availability.

---

## ✅ 2. **IAM (Identity and Access Management)**

### Q1. What is IAM in AWS?

**Ans:**
IAM allows you to manage users, groups, roles, and their permissions to securely control access to AWS resources.

---

### Q2. What are IAM Policies?

**Ans:**
Policies are JSON documents that define **permissions**. They can be **attached to users, groups, or roles** to allow or deny actions.

---

### Q3. What is the difference between IAM Role and IAM User?

| IAM User                      | IAM Role                                     |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Created for humans            | Created for AWS services or temporary access |
| Has long-term credentials     | Has temporary credentials                    |
| Login using username/password | No login; assumed by services                |

---

### Q4. What is the "principle of least privilege" in IAM?

**Ans:**
Only give the **minimum required permissions** to perform a task—nothing more.

---

## ✅ 3. **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**

### Q1. What is EC2?

**Ans:**
EC2 is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It allows you to launch virtual servers (instances).

---

### Q2. What are EC2 instance types?

**Ans:**

* **General Purpose** – t2, t3 (balanced)
* **Compute Optimized** – c5 (for CPU-heavy tasks)
* **Memory Optimized** – r5 (for RAM-intensive applications)
* **Storage Optimized** – i3 (for high IOPS storage)

---

### Q3. What are the EC2 purchasing options?

**Ans:**

* **On-Demand** – pay per hour/second
* **Reserved** – 1/3-year contract
* **Spot** – bid for unused capacity
* **Savings Plans** – flexible discount options

---

### Q4. What is an AMI?

**Ans:**
AMI (Amazon Machine Image) is a template that contains the software configuration (OS, application, etc.) used to launch an EC2 instance.

---

## ✅ 4. **S3 (Simple Storage Service)**

### Q1. What is S3?

**Ans:**
S3 is an object storage service that allows you to store and retrieve any amount of data at any time from anywhere.

---

### Q2. What are storage classes in S3?

**Ans:**

* Standard
* Intelligent-Tiering
* One Zone-IA
* Glacier
* Glacier Deep Archive

---

### Q3. Is S3 suitable for hosting static websites?

**Ans:**
Yes, S3 can host static websites by enabling **"Static Website Hosting"** in the bucket settings.

---

### Q4. What is the difference between S3 and EBS?

| Feature  | S3 (Object Storage) | EBS (Block Storage) |
| -------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| Use Case | Backup, media, logs | OS, DB, app data    |
| Access   | HTTP(S) API         | Attached to EC2     |
| Type     | Object              | Block               |

---

## ✅ 5. **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**

### Q1. What is VPC?

**Ans:**
VPC is a **logically isolated network** in AWS where you can launch AWS resources like EC2. You control IP range, subnets, route tables, and gateways.

---

### Q2. What are public and private subnets?

**Ans:**

* **Public Subnet**: Has a route to the internet via **Internet Gateway**
* **Private Subnet**: No direct route to the internet

---

### Q3. What is a NAT Gateway?

**Ans:**
NAT Gateway allows **instances in a private subnet** to access the internet **without being exposed** to inbound traffic.

---

### Q4. What is the difference between a Security Group and a NACL?

| Security Group   | NACL               |
| ---------------- | ------------------ |
| Instance level   | Subnet level       |
| Stateful         | Stateless          |
| Only allow rules | Allow + Deny rules |

---

## ✅ 6. **Route 53**

### Q1. What is Route 53?

**Ans:**
Amazon Route 53 is a **DNS (Domain Name System)** service that helps direct users to internet applications by translating domain names to IP addresses.

---

### Q2. What types of routing policies are in Route 53?

**Ans:**

* Simple
* Weighted
* Latency-based
* Failover
* Geolocation
* Geoproximity

---

### Q3. What is a hosted zone?

**Ans:**
It is a container for records (like A, CNAME) that defines how traffic is routed for a domain.

---

## ✅ 7. **Load Balancer**

### Q1. What is a Load Balancer in AWS?

**Ans:**
It distributes incoming traffic across multiple targets (EC2s) to ensure **high availability and fault tolerance**.

---

### Q2. What are types of Load Balancers?

**Ans:**

* **ALB (Application Load Balancer)** – works at Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS)
* **NLB (Network Load Balancer)** – works at Layer 4 (TCP/UDP)
* **CLB (Classic)** – older, Layer 4 & 7

---

### Q3. What is cross-zone load balancing?

**Ans:**
It allows the load balancer to distribute traffic **evenly across all registered targets in all Availability Zones**.

---

## ✅ 8. **Auto Scaling**

### Q1. What is Auto Scaling in AWS?

**Ans:**
Auto Scaling automatically **increases or decreases EC2 instances** based on demand, helping maintain performance and reduce cost.

---

### Q2. What is a Launch Template in Auto Scaling?

**Ans:**
It defines the configuration (AMI, instance type, key pair, etc.) used to launch EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling Group.

---

### Q3. What are scaling policies?

**Ans:**
They define **how** and **when** to scale in or out.
Types:

* **Target tracking**
* **Step scaling**
* **Scheduled scaling**
